Hi! My name is Jasper Conneway
I'm currently obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Southern New Hampshire University. 
In my spare time I spend time with my Girlfriend and our two dogs and work out at the gym

The Airgead Banking program displays a screen to the user to take data for an investment. The user will input their investment amount, the monthly amount they would deposit, the annual interest rate, and the amount of years the investment would grow. The program would then show the user their year end balance and accumulated interest for each year the investment grows. The user is able to change the deposit amount, interest rate, and number of years the investment will grow. 

I had an investment class separate from the banking app class. Header classes separate from their implementation classes. The data was collected and displayed correctly. The user was able to change values of the investment and have the data displayed. 

I would like to enhance the display that gathers input from the user. The display should allow the user to input data on the same line as the data request. I would have to do more research on how this is possible, if it is possible. 

The display was the hardest as I wanted the user to input their values on the same line as the data request. I wasnâ€™t able to figure it out. Instead I printed the menu and then printed the line I was requesting one at a time. 

Being able to write classes separately to allow other projects to use them for something else. This would ensure no redundant or duplicate code when not necessary. 

Program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Usage of proper naming conventions. Comments throughout the code. Usage of header classes.
